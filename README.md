# Banking-system
OOP project that I did for my OOP course @ FMI, Sofia University.

The banking system is a console application designed to simulate basic banking functions. The system supports several user roles, including Customers, Bank Employees and Third Party Employees, each with their specific commands and operations.

### Functionalities for Customers:
